This script calculates the reflected ray vector using the incident and normal ray vectors in case of a plane mirror.
It also verifos that this particlar equation is valid for reflaction from plane mirrors by calculation the angles the incident and reflected ray vectors make with the normal vector.
The mirror is considered to be parallel to the x-axis hence, the normal is always perpendicular to the x-axis.
User has to enter the position of the source of light in coordinates and the angle of reflaction.
The program will specify the components of the reflected vector and the angles made by the incident and relected rays with the normal.
A ray diagam will also be generated showing the point of incidence of the x-axis. 
Changes can be made to the script to disply the exact point of incidence.
